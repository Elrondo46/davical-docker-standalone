# CODE OF CONFLICT (REFUSE CODE OF CONDUCT)

Free software development is a very personal process compared to traditional software development methods. Your code and the ideas behind it will be carefully reviewed, often resulting in criticism. 
This review will almost always require improvements to the code before integration. 
Please be aware that this is due to the desire of all involved to find the best possible solution for the overall success of free software. 
This development process has proven its ability to create a sustainable and robust system like GNU/Linux, and we do not wish to in any way undermine the quality of submissions or the final outcome of this project.

However, if anyone feels personally mistreated, threatened, or otherwise uncomfortable as a result of this process, this is unacceptable. In this regard, please contact us directly.
